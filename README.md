# Tech Blog

## My Repository

In this GitHub repository, you will find my CMS-style Tech Blog application, which has been deployed to Heroku, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers' posts too. I developed this application following the MVC paradigm and used Handlebars.js as the templating language.

## Installation

This application does not need to be installed, as it can be viewed live on Heroku at the following URL. [https://ben-pauley-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/dashboard](https://ben-pauley-tech-blog.herokuapp.com/dashboard)

## Software Used

The development of this project was completed using Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench, Node.js, and sequelize, mysql2, express, bcrypt and dotenv packages, as well as Handlebars.js for templating.

## Conclusion

Overall, I found the development of this application incredibly challenging. I know I didn't meet every single criteria set out, but I gave every one the best attempt I could, given the time constraints. In the future, I would like to meet all of the criteria, fix any bugs, of which there are a few, and improve the styling and layout of the page.
